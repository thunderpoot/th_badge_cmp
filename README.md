## th_badge_cmp

Simple script to compare badges for two Telehack users.  Uses `/u/username.json` API, rather than HTML user page `/u/username` URL.

Originally by [**drsleepy**](https://telehack.com/u/drsleepy), thanks for sharing your script with the world.

After something like 60 hours of Coursera classes on Python, I felt like I was ready to start fiddling with it. BIG thanks to [**underwood**](https://telehack.com/u/underwood) for helping me debug and make it... work.

You can find me on Telehack (https://telehack.com/u/pbernicc).

### Usage:
`  $ ./th_badge_cmp.py <user1> <user2>`

### TODO:

Working on pretty formatting, first space-delimited format, and basic ANSI coloring.
May add arguments to go back to original single-column (newline) formatting if preferred.
